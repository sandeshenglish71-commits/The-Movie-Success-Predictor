# The-Movie-Success-Predictor
The Problem The film industry is a high-risk business where millions of dollars are invested with uncertain returns. My goal was to answer a critical financial question: "Can we predict a movie's box office success before it is released?" I wanted to build a model that could classify films as potential "Blockbusters" or financial risks based on pre-release data.

The Solution I analyzed a dataset of over 5,000 films to uncover the drivers of revenue.
